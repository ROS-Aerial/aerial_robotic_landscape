# Outdoor 3D Planning

This page is a central landing page for outdoor 3D planning in aerial robotics. 

## Development Kanban Board

Developers in the ROS Aerial Working Group keep track of their work for outdoor 3D planning [in a Kanban board.](https://github.com/orgs/ROS-Aerial/projects/1/views/2).

## Goals

* Create open source algorithms for planning and navigation in outdoor 3D environments
* Add plugins for ROS-based planners to communicate with common autopilots including PX4 and ArduPilot
* Create visualization tooling for viewing 3D plans in outdoor environments
* Create simulations of vehicles in order to demonstrate and test features
* Support intuitive ROS 2 interfaces to many components
* Demonstrate capabilities on physical hardware by performing flight tests and demonstrations
