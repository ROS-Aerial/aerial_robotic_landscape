# Aerial Robotic Landscape

This is the start of the aerial robotics landscape! Let the information gathering... begin!

The following list has been compiled during the startup meeting of this workgroup:

* [Autonomy stacks for UAVs](aerial_autonomy_stacks.md)
* [Autopilot suites](autopilots_suites.md)
* [Aerial robotics simulation](simulation.md)
* Message standards for UAV
* Communication for swarms of UAVs
* [Safety and management systems](safety_management.md)
* [Tutorials and education](education_and_tutorial.md)
* Legality and airspace access
* [Hardware, Components, and Dev Kits](hardware.md)
* [Aerial Vehicle Types](aerial_vehicles.md)
* [Outdoor Planning in 3D](3d_planning_outdoor.md)
* Indoor Planning in 3D
* [Middleware and Drivers](middleware_and_drivers.md)
