# Aerial Robotic Landscape

This is the start of the aerial robotics landscape! Let the information gathering... begin!

The following list has been compiled during the startup meeting of this workgroup:

* [Autonomy stacks for UAVs](aerial_autonomy_stacks.md)
* Non-Autonomy Packages for UAVs
* Aerial robotics simulation
* Message standards for UAV
* Communication for swarms of UAVs
* [Safety and management systems](safety_management.md)
* [Tutorials and education](education_and_tutorial.md)
* Legality and airspace access
* Hardware, Components, and Dev Kits
* Aerial Vehicle Types
* Planning in 3D
