# Aerial Autonomy Stacks

Based on [this discussion in Discourse]( https://discourse.ros.org/t/more-aerial-autonomy-stacks/30992/) and [our startup meeting](https://discourse.ros.org/t/start-up-meeting-aerial-robotics-wg/30869), we can define an aerial autonomy stack as follows:

> An aerial autonomy robotics stack is a collection of building blocks that enable the development of autonomous aerial vehicles, by providing a modular and scalable architecture for sensing, perception, planning, and control tasks. It allows unmanned aerial vehicles to perform complex missions without human intervention, while accommodating different hardware configurations and simulation environments.

## VIO packages

Visual Inertial Odometry packages is an very important strategy of positioning within GPS deprived environments. Since UAVs can not use wheel odometry and heavily relient on cameras, this is one of the main drivers for autonomous exploration with these vehicles.

Here is a list of VIO packages that people can use if they have a [depth camera](hardware.md) on their platform.

- [OpenVins](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins?tab=readme-ov-file) (ROS1/ROS2):
- [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion) stand alone
- [SLAMcore](https://www.slamcore.com/products/slamcore-sdk/) stand alone SDK
- [ORB-SLAM3 ROS2](https://github.com/suchetanrs/ORB-SLAM3-ROS2-Docker)

## Partial autonomy packages

A list of packages which don't comprise a full stack but do offer value on top of basic flight controller firmware.

* [MAVROS Controllers](https://github.com/Jaeyoung-Lim/mavros_controllers)

## Indoor navigation packages
Given the above [Aerial Autonomy Stacks](https://github.com/ROS-Aerial/aerial_robotic_landscape/blob/main/docs/aerial_autonomy_stacks.md#aerial-autonomy-stacks), the list below outlines specific implementations of indoor navigation software packages in ROS, running on aerial vehicle platforms. The list, though not exhaustive, provides a good overview of available off-the-shelf non-commercial software.
