# Aerial Vehicle Types and Categories

Usually, people tend to think about quadcopters when talking about aerial robotics, but there is actually a much larger variety of vehicle types available! Here's an attempt to list all of them if we can.

## Copters

Copters are aerial vehicles that use motors and propellers for their lift and maneuverability in 3D space.

These usually are categorized into the following subcategories:

* **Quadcopters:** The most common aerial vehicle used. It is driven by (as the name already indicates) 4 propellers and 4 motors.
* **Helicopters:** Like manned helicopters, unmanned helicopters are driven by one main rotor on top and one smaller one on the side for stability and maneuverability.
* **Hexacopters/Octocopters:** Copters with 6 or 8 rotors/motor combinations, respectively.
* **Tilt-Rotor Copters:** Copters that have motor and rotor combos that can change orientation.
* **Monocopters:** Monocopters are copters that are only driven by a single rotor and motor combo.

## Fixed Wing

Fixed-wing aerial vehicles use fixed wings for takeoff lift and control.

These are the subcategories:

* **Regular Fixed Wings:** Like regular airplanes, fixed-wing UAVs have 2 wings with a form of propulsion.
* **Hybrid / VTOL:** These vehicles can take off like a quadcopter vertically but can transition and act like a fixed-wing vehicle for the remainder of the flight.
* **Gliding UAVs:** These are fixed-wing UAVs without any propulsion and are therefore reliant on wind and thermal currents.

## Flapping Wing

Flapping wing aerial vehicles, also called ornithopters, generate lift through flapping their wings.

## Blimps

Blimps or airships can also be used as aerial vehicles as well. These vehicles stay buoyant by using a balloon with lighter-than-air gas. Maneuverability is either done with flapping wings or rotors.


## List to support vehicles per autopilot suite

Each autopilot suite have their a wide range of supported vehicles, to which this itemized list is referenced to. Note that these lists also include non-aerial vehicles as well.
