# Education and tutorials

This page will contain a list of education courses or tutorials for aerial robotics.
This is a partly compilation of [this ROS discourse thread](https://discourse.ros.org/t/how-did-you-get-started-in-aerial-robotics/31512) and the May meeting about [tutorials and education](https://discourse.ros.org/t/may-2023-meetings-aerial-robotics/31231/5) and some googling :)

This also includes input from [a Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7079385991144185856/) for a call of suggestions. This has been an adaption from the following [Bitcraze Blogpost](https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/07/online-courses-in-aerial-robotics/), and [the overview presentation done for the ROS-aerial CWG meetings](https://discourse.ros.org/t/august-2023-meetings-aerial-robotics/32809/8)

_This section showes university courses that have released recordings of lectures, slides and/or assignments. For instructions participants would need to follow the actual course at that one university._

### Brown Uni's Introduction to Robotics
Brown University offers a course called **‘Introduction to Robotics’** taught by Prof. Stefanie Tellix. While the introduction covers generic robotics, the focus of the full course is on building and programming the _Duckiedrone_. The course dives straight into autonomy and also teaches students how to work with _ROS_.

### Uni. of Washington's Introduction to Robotics

The **‘Bio-inspired Robotics’** course at the University of Washington, led by Prof. Sawyer Fuller, explores the realm of drawing inspiration from nature rather than reinventing the wheel. It covers various robots inspired by creatures capable of swimming, walking, hopping, and of course, flying. Lab assignments in this course involve working with a _Crazyflie_ drone.

* Year last updated: **2023**

## Code Examples

Here are some code examples that can be used as reference for experiments.
 
### Mambo ROS Examples
**Mambo ROS Examples:** This is a collection of experiments targeted Parrot Mambo drones, there are experiments with one or multiple vehicles at the same time. It runs over ROS over BLE, and some test are adapted to make use of a Vicon MoCap system. From a control theory's perspective, it showcases an optional robust control strategy, using an H-Infinity controller with perturbation estimation and a identified dynamic model of a Parrot Mambo drone.
