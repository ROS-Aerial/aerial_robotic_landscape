## Components

Many of the UAVs are usually built by hand and composed of different components. This usually consists of a drone frame, flight controller boards, companion computers and of course motors, batteries and ESCs.

### Drone Frames

Many drone frames are usually built from carbon fiber and custom-made for application or research.
There are some frames that are provided that will provide some base:
- [DJI Flame wheel ARF kit F550, F450, F330](https://www-v1.dji.com/flame-wheel-arf/feature.html)

### Companion Computers

For the drones that can carry it, the companion computers are important since they can do additional computations that the flight controller can not easily do.
As these are capable of running some form of Linux, these can handle for instance  computer vision with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) or run nodes with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). 
Some companion computers also integrate flight control (RTOS) hardware in the same package
