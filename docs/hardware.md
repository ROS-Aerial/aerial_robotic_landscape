# Hardware
The main hardware components of drones can be seperated into processors, sensors, telemetry, and motor drivers (speed controllers). Here we compare the current avalible options for each compenent and further categorize each one of them based on type and functionality.

Above is an example wiring diagram of a UAV using the [Holybro Pixhawk 5X Flight Controller](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/flight_controller/pixhawk5x.html) in family of Pixhawk® flight controllers. **Note** This a relativly advanced controller, here to illustrate what the wiring diagram of a UAV might look like. Simpler controllers might not be as complex depending on requirments.

## Processors 
Processors are the main component in which computation takes place within a UAV. All electrical components such as sensors and telemetry are connected to this system. A UAV can consist of 1 or multiple processors depending on complexity, typically this is structed into a primary procssor (flight controller) which handles low level operations such as internal pose estimation and navigation, and secondary processors (companion computers) which are used for high level autonomy such as perception sensing or onboard decisions planning.

### Companion Computers
For the drones that can carry it, the companion computers are important since they can do additional computations that the flight controller can not easily do. As these are capable of running some form of Linux, these can handle for instance  computer vision with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) or run nodes with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). 
Some companion computers also integrate flight control (RTOS) hardware in the same package
