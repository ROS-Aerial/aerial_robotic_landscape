### Quick Changes in Github

Simple changes to existing pages can be done by clicking the "Edit on
Github" link that appears at the top of every page.

To edit an existing page:
1. Open the page.
2. Click the Edit on Github link on top of the page.
3. Make the changes in the online editor.
4. Below the Github page editor you'll be prompted to create a separate branch and then guided to submit a pull request.

Once you submit the team will review your change request and either
provide feedback on how to improve or just merge it, resulting in the
website getting updated.

### Changes using Git (New Pages and Images)

More substantial changes, including adding new pages or adding/modifying images, aren't as easy to make (or properly test) on Github. For these kinds of changes we suggest using the same approach as for code:

1. Use the git toolchain to get the documentation source code onto your local computer with `git clone git@github.com:ROS-Aerial/aerial_robotic_landscape.git`
2. Modify the documentation as needed (add, change, delete).
3. Test that it builds properly with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). Check out their documentation for building the website and trying the website locally. 
4. Create a branch for your changes and create a pull request (PR) to pull it back into the documentation.
