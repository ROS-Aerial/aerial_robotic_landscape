# Simulation of Aerial Robotics

Simulation is crucial when working with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Testing different trajectories and control paradigms in a simulator before implementing them on the real platform ensures not only safety but also facilitates development.

This page presents several simulator options for aerial robotics enthusiasts.

## Comparison

The following simulators have their own integrated physics simulation and basic rendering capabilities. They are capable of simulating the aerodynamic forces necessary to keep UAVs airborne:

For the following comparison, we have refered [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02296.pdf)

## Flight dynamics models

Some simulators mostly focus on creating accurate dynamics for aerial vehicles. Here are some options:

* JSBSim (<https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim>)
* YASim (<https://wiki.flightgear.org/YASim>)
* More to be added!

## Available UAV Models

Each simulator typically offers a range of ready-to-use aerial vehicle models:

* **Webots**: <https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=robot%2Fflying>

## Autopilot Suites

Several autopilot suites provide instructions for using simulators, often with Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) or Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) options:
