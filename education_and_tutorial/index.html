<li>Drone Dojo: For those looking to build their own drones, Drone Dojo provides useful instructions and courses to get started on DIY drone projects. Link: <a href="https://dojofordrones.com/">https://dojofordrones.com/</a></li>
<li>ETHx: Autonomous Mobile Robots: This course focuses on the principles of autonomous navigation and control of mobile robots, which could also be applicable for autonomy of drones. It covers topics such as perception, localization, planning, and control, which are essential for enabling robots to operate autonomously in dynamic environments. You can audit the course material for free with limited access.
