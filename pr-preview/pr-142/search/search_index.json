Here's an attempt to list all of them if we can. Copters Copters are aerial vehicles that use motors and propellers for their lift and maneuverability in 3D space. These usually are categorized into the following subcategories: Quadcopters: The most common aerial vehicle used. It is driven by (as the name already indicates) 4 propellers and 4 motors. Helicopters: Like manned helicopters, unmanned helicopters are driven by one main rotor on top and one smaller one on the side for stability and maneuverability. Hexacopters/Octocopters: Copters with 6 or 8 rotors/motor combinations, respectively. Tilt-Rotor Copters: Copters that have motor and rotor combos that can change orientation. Monocopters: Monocopters are copters that are only driven by a single rotor and motor combo. Fixed Wing Fixed-wing aerial vehicles use fixed wings for takeoff lift and control. These are the subcategories: Regular Fixed Wings: Like regular airplanes, fixed-wing UAVs have 2 wings with a form of propulsion. Hybrid / VTOL: These vehicles can take off like a quadcopter vertically but can transition and act like a fixed-wing vehicle for the remainder of the flight. Gliding UAVs: These are fixed-wing UAVs without any propulsion and are therefore reliant on wind and thermal currents. Flapping Wing Flapping-wing aerial vehicles generate both lift and thrust by their flapping wings. There are two main subcategories: Ornithopters: These are the traditional bird-like flapping-wing UAVs. The flapping wings generate lift and thrust and an airplane-like tail with traditional control surfaces is used for stbility and flight control. Some minimal forward velocity needs to be maintained such the wings produce sufficient lift. Only some smaller vehicles demonstrate limited VTOL and hovering capability. These vehicles can be passively stabilized by the tail surfaces and do not require active stabilization, similar to fixed-wing UAVs. Tail-less flapping-wing UAVs: These vehicles fly like insects and hummingbirds - they can hover, take-off and land vertically, and fly in any direction (forward & backward, sideways, up & down). Lift/thrust is generated by the flapping wings, whose geometry and/or motion is adjustable for flight control. Like multicopters, these vehicles require active stabilization, typically by using an onboard IMU. Blimps Blimps or airships can also be used as aerial vehicles as well. These vehicles stay buoyant by using a balloon with lighter-than-air gas. Maneuverability is either done with flapping wings or rotors. List to support vehicles per autopilot suite Each autopilot suite have their a wide range of supported vehicles, to which this itemized list is referenced to. Note that these lists also include non-aerial vehicles as well.

Safety systems are important for all, but the bigger an aerial vehicle becomes, the more important it becomes that the right fail-safes and emergency systems are in place! This pages gives an overview of those safety systems that have been implemented so far. Safety in ROS Currently specifically for aerial vehicles, the safety implementation is depended on the ROS autonomy stack used. The ROS-0147 has a suggestion for flightmodes for a statemachine that can simplify the understanding of it. It is also expecting that ROS will be run offboard on an external computer, and that it should be in control of the safety state machine. This should probably be discussed if it would be a good idea for ROS to be in control of this or the autopilot suites themselves. Safety in Autopilot suites Adapted from the following blogpost: https://www.bitcraze.io/2023/04/safety-and-the-brushless/ These are current Safety managements systems existing in Paparazzi UAV , Betaflight , ArduPilot and PX4 . The Crazyflie ecosystem also have some measures but are currently overhauling their safety framework now in the form of a supervisor. Pre-flight checks. Before a vehicle can fly, certain conditions must be met. These includ: calibrating and ensuring functionality of internal sensors (IMU, barometer, magnetometer) receiving a GPS signal converging the internal state estimator (usually an extended Kalman filter) to a position checking for remote control connection and datalink to a ground station conducting feasibility checks (e.g., mission parameters, start location proximity) confirming sufficient battery level, and ensuring the absence of error states from previous flights or crashes. Preflight checks documentation: PX4: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/flying/pre_flight_checks.html#preflight-sensor-estimator-checks ArduPilot: https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-prearm-safety-checks.html#failure-messages Beta flight: https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/guides/current/GPS-Rescue-v4-4#sanity-check-options Paparazzi UAV: Indicated per platform if necessary, on their wiki: https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Failsafe Crazyflie firmware: https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/functional-areas/supervisor/ Fail-safe mechanisms After passing pre-flight checks and arming the UAV, the takeoff command is given. However, UAV flights have inherent risks, particularly during takeoff. To mitigate these risks, numerous safety features, known as failsafes, are implemented during the flight phase. These failsafes are categorized as triggers and behaviors, allowing developers to specify the UAV's response to different failures, such as initiating a safe landing in the event of GPS loss. Triggers Thus, there are triggers that can enable the autopilot\u2019s failsafe mechanics: No connection with the remote control No connection with the Ground station or Datalink Low Battery Position estimate diverges or full GPS loss Waypoint going beyond geofence or Mission is not feasible Other vehicles are nearby. Also, sometimes the support of an external Automatic Trigger system is required, which is a box that monitors the conditions where the UAV should take action in case there is no GPS, other aerial vehicles are nearby, or the UAV is crossing a geofence determined by outdoor flight restrictions. Note that all of these triggers usually have a couple of conditions attached, such as the level of the \u2018low battery\u2019 or the number of seconds of \u2018GPS loss\u2019 deemed acceptable. Fail-safe behaviors During UAV flights, safety features can be customized per trigger, deviating from the default actions set by regulations. Disarming the vehicle completely increases the risk of crashing and causing harm. Allowing the drone to autonomously complete the mission without intervention poses the risk of losing the vehicle or trespassing restricted areas. Modifying default behaviors should be undertaken by knowledgeable individuals with careful consideration. These behaviors can include the following: No action at all Warning on the console or remote control display Continue the mission autonomously Stay still at the same position or go to a home position Fly to a lower altitude Land based on position or safely land by reducing thrust No input to motors or completely disarming the motors Fail-safe documentation PX4: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/safety.html ArduPilot: https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/failsafe-landing-page.html Betaflight: https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/guides/current/Failsafe Paparazzi UAV: https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Failsafe Crazyflie firmware: https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/functional-areas/supervisor/ Emergencies Fail-safes ensure safe flight, but emergencies like crashes, flips, or hardware failures can still occur. In such cases, the standard default action is to disarm the vehicle to prevent unintended motor activation. Backup systems connected to ESCs may take over if the autopilot becomes unresponsive. The pilot plays a vital role in safety, with the remote control featuring a dedicated button or switch for different modes, enabling actions like landing or disarming. It's recommended to have a net or towel to stop spinning motors and to promptly disconnect the battery. Being prepared for potential LiPo battery hazards is essential, with sand or fire retardant on hand. While autopilots provide guidance, conducting thorough research on handling emergencies, spinning parts, and LiPo battery fires is crucial. Here a list of that: * Remote control should have a dedicated button/switch for different modes, landing, or disarming. * Dealing with spinning motors Use a net or towel to stop them and promptly disconnect the battery. * To prepare for LiPo battery hazards, Have sand or fire retardant available.
